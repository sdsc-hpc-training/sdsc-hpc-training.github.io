      <p class="indent"><b>SDSC GPU Hackathon - COVID-19 Update</b></p>
      <p class="indent">We find ourselves facing a unique and potentially challenging time with the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
        As we continue making plans for the upcoming GPU Hackathon hosted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center
        (SDSC) on May 11 â€“ 15, 2020, we are considering adjustments that may be required if travel becomes
        limited or participants prefer not to travel. Our application deadline of March 11 and notification
        date of March 25 remain intact at this time. Our current plan is to continue to monitor the COVID-19
        situation, and no later than one month prior to our event, on April 11, make a determination if the
        GPU Hackathon can in part or full be offered remotely. For the latest COVID-19 updates see:</p>

          <p id="paral">This GPU hackathon is designed as a multi-day intensive coding event.  Given the current impact of COVID-19 this event has been adjusted to be held remotely starting with a single preparation day 2 weeks prior to a 3-day coding event.  This event pairs application teams with experts in programming and performance. The goal of the event is to port and optimize codes on GPU technologies in a focused, highly collaborative environment. GPU hackathons are part of an international program organized by NVIDIA to help train scientists and researchers to accelerate and optimize their applications on GPUs.</p>

            <p id="paral">Each code team should consist of 4-6 code developers that together are
              intimately knowledgeable of the code. If a team proposal consists
              of a suite of applications, no more than two applications should
              be sent to the hackathon. For each individual code, at least 2 people
              must attend. Teams will be complimented by mentors that will be
              assigned based on expert knowledge that matches the needs of the code.
              Expertise in GPU computing is not required.
              Selected teams will have access to large-scale GPU clusters
              for the duration of the event, including preparation and follow-up testing.</p>

                <p id="paral">Anyone developing or using HPC scientific codes seeking performance
                  improvements, or porting to GPU systems in a cooperative, hands-on
                  environment should apply. Codes should primarily be written in a GPU
                  compatible language, such as C++, Fortran and/or Python.
                  Codes can use/want any standard method of offloading work to the GPUs,
                  including CUDA, RAPIDS, CUDA Fortran, OpenACC, OpenCL or OpenMP.
                  The SDSC GPU hackathon is interested in teams who are working with
                  “long-tail” computational science applications that run well on the
                  Comet (or future Expanse) architectures. However, all coding teams
                  looking to use GPU technologies are encouraged to apply. A broad
                  range of code types and GPU experience levels are sought for this event.</p>

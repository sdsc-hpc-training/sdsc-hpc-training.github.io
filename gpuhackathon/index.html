<blockquote>
We find ourselves facing a unique and potentially challenging time with the spread of the COVID-19.  
As we continue making plans for the upcoming GPU Hackathon hosted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center 
(SDSC) on May 11 – 15, 2020, we are considering adjustments that may be required if travel becomes 
limited or participants prefer not to travel. Our application deadline of March 11 and notification 
date of March 25 remain intact at this time. Our current plan is to continue to monitor the COVID-19 
situation, and no later than one month prior to our event, on April 11, make a determination if the 
GPU Hackathon can in part or full be offered remotely.

<b>Good News - IF travel is a consideration</b>
<p>The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) will extend scholarships to team members 
who are Comet users interested in attending the GPU Hackathon.  Qualifying team members 
are required to be active users of Comet, and demonstrate the need for funding to attend. 
Selected teams will be award up to $1000.00 to be used towards expenses associated with 
travel to the event, including; air, hotel, ground transportation and meals not covered 
by event. The scholarships are generously funded by the National Science Foundation 
(NSF Award #1341698) and its support of Comet education goals. Travel guidelines in 
accordance with the UC San Diego and NSF will apply.

    <p id="paral">The SDSC GPU hackathon is a 5-day intensive coding event that pairs
    application teams with experts in programming and performance.
    The goal of the event is to port and optimize codes on GPU technologies
    in a focused, highly collaborative environment. GPU hackathons are part
    of an international program organized by NVIDIA to help train scientists
    and researchers to accelerate and optimize their applications on GPUs.</p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left' valign='top'>
    <p id="paral">Each code team should consist of 4-6 code developers that together are
    intimately knowledgeable of the code. If a team proposal consists
    of a suite of applications, no more than two applications should
    be sent to the hackathon. For each individual code, at least 2 people
    must attend. Teams will be complimented by mentors that will be
    assigned based on expert knowledge that matches the needs of the code.
    Expertise in GPU computing is not required.
    Selected teams will have access to large-scale GPU clusters
    for the duration of the event, including preparation and follow-up testing.</p>

  </td></tr>
  <tr><td align='left' valign='top'>
    <p id="paral">Anyone developing or using HPC scientific codes seeking performance
    improvements, or porting to GPU systems in a cooperative, hands-on
    environment should apply. Codes should primarily be written in a GPU
    compatible language, such as C++, Fortran and/or Python.
    Codes can use/want any standard method of offloading work to the GPUs,
    including CUDA, RAPIDS, CUDA Fortran, OpenACC, OpenCL or OpenMP.
    The SDSC GPU hackathon is interested in teams who are working with
    “long-tail” computational science applications that run well on the
    Comet (or future Expanse) architectures. However, all coding teams
    looking to use GPU technologies are encouraged to apply. A broad
    range of code types and GPU experience levels are sought for this event.</p>

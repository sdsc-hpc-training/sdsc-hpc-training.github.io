I"Q<p>Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Thanks to the help of the JONATHAN MCGLONE @ http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/.</p>

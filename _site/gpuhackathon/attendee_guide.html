A GPU hackathon is a 5-day coding event in which your team of developers will
prepare your application(s) to run on GPUs, or focus on optimizing your application(s)
that currently run on GPUs. Your team should consist of three or more developers who are
intimately familiar with (some part of) your application, and you will work alongside
1-2 mentors with GPU programming expertise. The mentors come from universities,
national laboratories, supercomputing centers, government institutions, and vendors.
    </p>
    <p> &nbsp; </p>
    <p class="paral">
Note, this document assumes a 5-day event held Monday - Friday from 8 AM - 5 PM
each day except Friday, where the event officially ends sometime between 1-3 PM.

            <p class="indent">This section outlines recommendations gathered from
              participants and mentors over the years on how to prepare for a
              hackathon. While each team will proceed differently in practice,
              we find that teams who follow these suggestions typically have the
              greatest success.  </p>

          <p> &nbsp; </p>
              <p class="indent">
            During the hackathon, your team will work alongside your mentor(s)
            on the goals you have (hopefully) set during the pre-hackathon meetings.
            In addition, there are presentations and morning updates that your
            team will participate in.</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Introduction Presentations:</b></p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="indent">
On Monday morning, the first order of business will be for one member of each
team to give a short (5 minutes / 5 slides) presentation introducing their team.
Ideally, this should include an introduction of your team members, a very brief
description of your application, a profile of your code (showing compute-intensive
regions), and your goals for the week (parts of your code you will be targeting,
anticipated speedup, intended programming model - e.g. OpenACC, CUDA, etc.).
NOTE: It is important to keep these presentations brief to maximize the amount
of time the teams have to hack code, so although the science behind your
application is probably very interesting, please limit the presentation to the
relevant parts of your code needed to convey your work at the hackathon. Also,
remember that most participants are probably not familiar with your specific
domain, so please keep the jargon to a minimum.
</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Morning Updates (Scrum Sessions):</b></p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="indent">On Tuesday through Thursday mornings,
  each team will give a short (3 minute / 2-3 slides) update, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>Progress made since last update.</li>
  <li>Goals for the day.</li>
  <li>Problems you are currently facing.</li>
  <li>Problems you have resolved (that other teams might find useful).</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In addition to sharing your progress, these updates are opportunities to
get feedback from other teams and mentors. There is a chance that a
problem you are facing has already been encountered and resolved by someone else. Or you might have found and resolved a problem (or reported a bug) that other teams might currently be facing. These hackathons are meant to be cooperative events among all participants, and these update sessions are central to that theme.
</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Final Presentations:</b></p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="indent">On Friday morning, the teams will finish up their development work for the week and give a final presentation (5-7 minutes / 5-7 slides) detailing their accomplishments; issues they ran into, how they resolved them, speedups they obtained, as well as their closing thoughts on the event and what they learned. The final day typically ends around 1-3 PM to allow participants to arrange travel home.

    <p class="sectitle">Acknowledgements:</p>
    <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="indent">If the work you accomplish at the hackathon leads to a
          future publication, we encourage you to recognize the mentor(s) and
          hackathon in the acknowledgement section of the publication. E.g.,</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p class="indent"><em>The authors would like to thank [Organizers of event]
            for organizing the [Year][Name of Specific Hackathon] and give special
            thanks to our mentors [Name of Mentor(s)] for their contributions
            to this work</em></p>
                </blockquote>
          <p class="indent">Remember, the mentors volunteer their time to help at
            these events and such recognition is a nice way of saying thank you.</p>

We are always looking for ways to improve these events. If you have feedback you
believe would help improve this document or the hackathons themselves, please
feel free to contact Susan Rathbun (susan at sdsc.edu) or Mary Thomas
